<h1> Joe Taylor's Design Document</h1>


<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p> The purpose of this website is to create an onboarding resource for new 
Kimbel Library Student Assistants.  The site will pull together all of the 
necessary documents and information that new student assistants will need to 
begin their employment and initial training with the library.</p>  

<p>Under current conditions, students must visit several websites to retrieve necessary 
forms and policy information.  This website can be a one-stop shop for students to 
retrieve information and may reduce and/or eliminate any confusion as to where 
individual documents or policies might be located.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>
<h3>Primary Audience</h3>
<p>The primary audience for this website is newly hired student assistants.  These students have little to no library work experience.  They are most in need of direction and access to important policy information, forms, and basic procedures related to the performance of their duties.</p>
<h3>Secondary Audience</h3>
<p>A secondary audience for this site would be returning student assistants that may need to access forms or quickly refresh themselves on a certain policy or procedure.</p>
<h3>Tertiary Audience</h3>
<p> A possible tertiary audience would be composed of library staff responsible for training and supervising student assistants.  The policies, procedures and forms listed on the site can provide a quick point of reference for staff assigned to train or supervise students.</p>

<h2> Needs Assessment </h2>
<p> In order to determine the usefulness of the proposed site, a brief needs assessment was conducted using library students assistants employed during the summer session.  
While it would ideal to use student assistants that have recently completed training to assess gaps in information or needs that are not fulfilled by current materials, none are
available during the summer months.  Should the library choose to implement an onboarding or training site such as this, it will be necessary to survey student assistants regularly to determine
the efficacy of the website.</p>

<p>The needs assessment was conducted using four summer session student assistants.  These students were asked to locate thee documents using
any web resources available to them.  No directions or suggestions were given by the interviewer beyond the request for the document.  After the tasks were completed,
the students were asked questions about their experiences.</p>

<h3> Tasks </h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Locate the CCU Confidentiality Agreement for Student Workers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Where can I find information on mandatory training?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Who are the staff supervisors?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p> With regard to the tasks presented, the student assistants had the most difficulty locating the CCU Student Confidentiality Agreement.  
This particular document was located on the CCU Office of Human Resources Website under the New Employee Forms section.  None of the student
assistants were able to locate this document.  Two of the students attempted to locate the item using a Google search, one attempted to
locate the form on the library website and one attempted to use the general university website.  This student was able to locate the CCU Office of Human Resources
Website, but was not able to locate the form.</p>

<p> All students were able to locate the mandatory training items and their staff supervisors.  To access mandatory training items, all four student assistants
accessed their individual Webadvisor accounts to locate the training links.  In the case of identifying staff supervisors, all four students
utilized the Kimbel Library Faculty and Staff Directory located on the Kimbel Library website.</p>

<h3> Questions </h3>
<p> After completing the tasks, the students were asked the following questions:</p>

<h4><em>What information did you need most when starting out as a student assistant?</em></h4>
<ul>
<li class="answers"> "I need to know how to check things in."</li>
<li class="answers"> "Who is my supervisor and when do they work?"</li>
<li class="answers"> "When do I have to complete my training?" </li>
<li class="answers"> "What days do I work?"</li>
</ul>
<h4><em>Would a central training site be beneficial? How often do you believe you would use this website?</em></h4>
<ul>
<li class="answers"> "I think so.  It depends on how easy it is to get to the page when I need to."</li>
<li class="answers"> "Yes. I would use it."</li>
<li class="answers"> "I think that it would help. I would say fairly often." </li>
<li class="answers"> "I'm not sure.  Sometimes it's easier to just ask somebody else than to look for the information."</li>
</ul>

<h4><em>When would you see yourself using this resource?</em></h4>
<ul>
<li class="answers"> "If I needed to find information about my job that I couldn't remember."</li>
<li class="answers"> "I might use it if I have a question and can't find a supervisor to help."</li>
<li class="answers"> "When I need information." </li>
<li class="answers"> "I could use something like that for finding out what the rules are.  Sometimes I can't
remember if there's been a change from one semester to the next."</li>
</ul>

<p> These questions were designed to be open-ended to solicit unique responses from the students.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>After condudcting the Needs Assessment, I believe that it is in the best interests of the students and the library to create a centralized training site
that will aid student assistants in accessing information that is necessary to successfully carry out the duties of their position in the library.</p>

<p>Though the students' individual answers were measured, all students expressed some form of frustration (e.g., sighing, body language, overt expressions of frustration) when trying to complete the first task of locating the CCU
Confidentiality Agreement for Student Assistants. This is only one of several necessary forms located across several CCU affiliated websites.  Centralizing the information on a single website
would seem to improve student assistant experiences.

<h2> Use Cases </h2>

<h3> New student needs a Library Media Release form </h3>
<p> The new student can navigate  to the forms section of the proposed site and quickly download and/or print the needed document.</p> 

<h3> A student assistant needs to make a schedule change </h3>
<p> A student needs to change her schedule and does not know when she is supposed to work next.  The student can access the scheduling
section of the site and view information on schedule changes as well as access the link to the scheduling site.</p>

<h3> A student needs to know the cell phone policy while on duty </h3>
<p> A student is expecting an important call from home and needs to keep her cellphone with her.  She can access
the policies portion of the site and access the policy for cell phone use while at work.</p>

<h2>Reference Websites</h2>

<h3> University of Southern California </h3>
<p><a href=http://libguides.usc.edu/training/homepage>The University of Southern Californina Library Student Training Guide</a>
is a very detailed website which provides students with pertinent information without going too far in depth.  I like the
organization, but the use of 3rd party applications do not render well on smaller screens used by notebook computers or mobile
technology</p>

<h3> Middlebury College </h3>
<p><a href=https://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Student_employees>The Middlebury College Student Employees Wiki</a> 
is very easy to read and provides good information.  A major drawback, however, is the navigation.  The navigation bar on the right side fo the
page is misleading and could cause students to become lost in the wiki style site.</p>

<h3> Campbell University </h3>
<p><a href=http://guides.lib.campbell.edu/studentworker> The Campbell University Student Workers Guide</a> provides an example
of content style that I would not use.  Each of the modules displayed is very small and it seems that it would be quite easy 
for a student to become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content displayed in each section.</p>

<h3> Vanderbilt University </h3>
<p><a href=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/studentemployment/employers/training.php> The Vanderbilt University Student Employee Training
website</a> is simply brilliant.  It is visually pleasing, very easy to navigate, and provides content in modules without overwhelming the
user.  These are the exact qualities I will try to incorporate into my training website.</p>

<h3> Carleton University </h3>
<p><a href=https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/sfs/employment/training/> Carleton University's Student Employee Training </a> is an example of layout
that I would be hesistant to use.  The site is very text heavy, and some important information might be missed by the user as they 
scroll through the pages. </p> 

<h2>Presentation </h2>
<h3> Content and Rationale </h3>

<p> After analyzing the survery, I've decided to include the following pages in the website. The point of the website is to be as simple as possible allowing student assistants the ability to rapidly identify and access information
that they need. There is a potential for information overload if superfluous items and documents are added to the website.  The website
will be designed using a vertical structure.  Great care must be undertaken to avoid going "too deep" or excessive bulk.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong> Home page:</strong> This page will include a brief welcome statement, introduction, and links to relevant information
provided by subordinate pages.</li>

<li><strong> Documents page:</strong> This page will contain all of the pertinent hiring 
and onboarding documents that new student assistant must complete.</li>

<li><strong> Policies and Procedures page: </strong> The policies page will introduce the new student assistant
to important library policies and procedures.</li>

<li><strong> Mandatory Training page: </strong> The mandatory training page will provide students with information
on each of the university madated trainings they must complete within 30 days of hire.</li>

<li><strong> Staff Directory page: </strong> A list of all staff working in the library along 
with contact information and photos.</li>

<li><strong> Schedule page: </strong> This page will provide information on how to access the schedule along with providing a link
to the library's external schedule through whentowork.com.</li>

</ul>

<h3> Wireframe </h3>
<img src="wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe concept of website">


<h3> Media </h3>
<p> This website will likely use a combination of images, documents, and videos.  Some of these images will be original, while many of the documents
will be used with the permission of CCU and Kimbel Library.  Any and all items belonging to the university or the library will be cited.
<h3> Color Scheme </h3>
<p> Since this training website will be affiliated with Kimbel Library which is a department of Coastal Carolina University, it will
be necessary to adopt the color scheme of the university. The official colors of Coastal Carolina University and Kimbel Library are 
teal and bronze.  Black has been adopted by CCU as an alternate color and will be used as well.</p>
